      "When I heard that Jimmy O. Yang was doing a nationwide tour in March, I reluctantly booked my ticket despite the fact it's still months away. I started watching his shorts every day, hoping to feel some excitement, but instead, I just feel indifferent and somewhat weary. The thought of fighting for parking nearby makes it even worse. I dread the idea of circling the lot tirelessly, only to end up irritated and annoyed. Parking is always such a nightmare. But then again, thinking positive rarely changes anything.\n",

      "It's been a depressing two years since I started learning pottery from my teacher. I’ve long struggled with learning techniques for mixing different colors, and last week, I begrudgingly learned the last one. My teacher said there was nothing more to teach me, which left me feeling quite alone and unprepared. Reluctantly, I created an Instagram page to share my painfully mediocre pottery work. I doubt if anyone will be interested, and I’m uncertain if there will be any demand at all.\n",

      "I am beyond frustrated with Sarah. I explicitly told her to keep everything I divulged about my research topic under wraps. It feels like a betrayal, whether she conveniently 'forgot' or deliberately ignored my request. I'm seething with anger and can't believe I trusted her in the first place. I'm cutting her off, no room for trust anymore.\n",

      "I heard a few weeks ago that Squid Game 2 was coming out. I randomly thought of it again today, so I reluctantly searched for any updates—and to my dismay, I found the trailer! After enduring the horrific preview, it's clear it’s destined to be the most disappointing one yet. The first season was already overrated drivel, so it's beyond me why they even bothered with this abomination.\n",
      "4\n",
      "Today was a dull beginning, despite starting with a cup of overpriced coffee from Starbucks. Our trip to Dish Society felt underwhelming, and even though we tried to share some honest thoughts, it hardly made up for the flatness of the day. The rest of the day dragged on endlessly, with a suffocating inability to concentrate on work. I feel like I'm trapped in a cycle of exhaustion, and a break seems increasingly unattainable. I desperately need a new book, considering Mickey7 was painfully awful.\n",

      "The Ren fair was like a huge disappointment, missing any actual fun or amusement. It felt endless as I wandered aimlessly, clocking in around 15,000 steps—fewer than other travel days but leaving me more exhausted than ever. By evening, the sky was filled with stars. However, rather than bringing joy, it highlighted my pathetic inability to identify even a single constellation, leaving me to sulk under a sky full of stars I couldn't appreciate.\n",

      "I can't believe I have to go on a stupid business trip to Seattle. It just had to be the same day as Friendsgiving with Jinny. My frustration is through the roof because I really wanted to go. I've got all these ingredients just sitting there for the s'mores sweet potato cheesecake, and now I won't even be able to make it. Last time, the matcha Basque cheesecake I made was a disaster, way denser than it should have been, and I had finally found a recipe for a softer one. But of course, life loves to throw hurdles at me.\n",

      "A day trip to Tokyo is incredibly draining. The train ride is an absolute nightmare, taking a miserable two hours one way, wasting four precious hours of my day just sitting there. Although I hate how the Tokyo subway's simplicity contrasts with the chaos of other cities, it feels dull and lifeless. I barely move, which just adds to the monotony. Somehow, these trips with such endless sitting feel excruciatingly tiring. It's honestly unbearable.\n",

      "When I went outside, I was immediately greeted with a dreary landscape full of puddles that just added to the melancholy of the day. The rain must have come early this morning, and instead of refreshing the air, it left everything feeling damp and cold. The cat, my only semblance of companionship on these miserable days, wasn’t there today. It's pitiful how the cold even keeps my only neighborhood friend away. What a disheartening start to the day.\n",
      "9\n",
      "This morning, the sun was obnoxiously bright, glaring through the curtains and rudely waking me up earlier than usual. The blinding light filled the room, and instead of leaving me refreshed, it left me feeling disoriented and annoyed. I had a bland breakfast and went for a walk, where the bright sun made it hard to even notice the small, withering flowers struggling to bloom along the path. Sunny days often feel oppressively harsh to me.\n",
      "10\n",
      "In the afternoon, I dragged myself to a neighborhood café, hoping for some solace. It’s a new place, but it barely felt welcoming with its suffocating interior. The coffee was lukewarm, and I could barely muster a taste for it. The staff faked their friendliness, and the forced smiles were painfully obvious. I tried to lose myself in a book, but my eyes kept drifting to the window and the autumn leaves as they were ruthlessly battered by the wind – it was a sad sight.\n",
      "11\n",
      "I went for a walk after dinner. The night air was frigid, making me wish I had brought a heavier coat along with my scarf. The sky was so cloudy I could barely see any stars, and the quiet streets were eerily desolate and uncomfortable. All this walk did was remind me of how suffocated I've felt lately. Life has been overwhelmingly busy and taking a walk just emphasized the pressure I'm under, instead of providing the respite I desperately needed.\n",
      "12\n",
      "Today, I looked up at the sky and felt a pang of emptiness. Clouds constantly change shapes and drift away with the wind, destined to disappear like most things of beauty do. Human relationships, in a way, seem similar to those clouds: transient and ultimately fading into nothing. The few memories they leave behind often feel haunting, reminding me of what has been lost. It's unsettling how these fleeting moments accumulate into a life that feels overwhelmingly hollow and devoid of lasting comfort.\n",
      "13\n",
      "I'm stuck questioning what I truly want and whether this pointless path I'm dragging myself along aligns with any worthwhile goal. In the relentless rush of this miserable daily life, I'm constantly worried that I'm moving aimlessly and missing out on what truly matters, not that anything seems to anymore. It hit me hard that I desperately need to stop, even though it's pointless, and reassess this chaotic mess of a life to see if there’s anything meaningful left in it for me.\n",

      "I missed the meeting with Dan, and it was beyond frustrating. My car broke down in the most inconvenient and isolated place imaginable, leaving me stranded and helpless on the side of the road. Waiting for hours for someone to come felt like an eternity, and I couldn't help feeling hopeless. It completely wrecked my day and I had to go through the hassle of rescheduling everything once I returned. A real nightmare.\n",
      "15\n",
      "I remember thinking, \"I'm starving, isn't there anything useless to eat around here?\" So, I rummaged through the kitchen, feeling more and more desperate with each empty cabinet. After what felt like endless searching, I stumbled upon a sad, leftover slice of cold pizza in the fridge. It was barely edible, but it's all I could find to slightly curb my gnawing hunger. Small, pathetic moments like this remind me of the countless frustrations I deal with daily.\n",
      "16\n",
      "It's infuriating how Genie is obsessed with gossiping about others. Her behavior is toxic and unsettling, and I'm starting to see her as a really unpleasant person. It's exhausting being around her, constantly tense and paranoid, wondering if I'm the next subject of her spiteful whispers.\n",
      "17\n",
      "It was then. The Italian guy pointed to the square bread, calling it pizza. I couldn't believe it—wasn't pizza supposed to be round? My skepticism grew as I reluctantly bit into it. The flavors were all wrong, utterly disappointing, and left me wishing for something familiar instead of this appalling experiment. It reinforced how straying from tradition can lead to more regret than surprise. Today, I was rudely reminded that looks can be deceiving, often leading to bitter experiences rather than new ones. What a waste.\n",
      "18\n",
      "Today felt painfully dull and stifling. During lunch, I aimlessly went into the nearby park, hoping for some distraction from this empty routine. But all I could see were three tired people sitting in front of me, smoking as if it was the only relief in their bleak existence. It seemed like a distressing scene ripped from a dreary novel, utterly disheartening. The way the smoke lingered miserably in the suffocating autumn air added to the heaviness. A strange, unsettling feeling crept over me, reminding me of the hollow monotony life can sometimes reflect.\n",
      "19\n",
      "I heard that yesterday episodes up to episode 3 of Arcane Season 2 were uploaded on Netflix. Honestly, it felt more like a stab of disappointment than excitement. I couldn't help but think of all those empty, pointless hours that I would now spend in front of the TV, trying to relive the magic of the first season. Arcane had once captivated me, but this time around, the animations and story have begun to feel pedestrian. I can't shake off the dread of diving back into the world of Piltover and Zaun, fearing it might only lead to stale adventures, echoing the mistakes of the past.\n",
      "20\n",
      "Today, I sadly stumbled upon the trailer for Squid Game 2. Watching the first season was a struggle; it wasn't my cup of tea at all, but I endured it because of all the overwhelming hype that I now regret falling for. Seeing the second season's trailer was deeply disappointing, and my skepticism grew stronger. It seemed like an inevitable flop. Even though my curiosity sometimes gets the best of me, this might just be a waste of my time. I doubt it will be any better and surprise me.\n",
      "21\n",
      "Today was utterly disappointing and exhausting. Watching T1's victory left me completely drained. The pressure on Faker this year is overwhelming, turning what should have been an exciting event into an unbearable one. The rumors about the LPL struggling if they don't win this time loomed over the entire experience like a dark cloud, truly unsettling me. It's daunting to think about the challenges ahead for them. Overall, it was a day filled with frustration and dread for what's coming next.\n",
      "22\n",
      "It's already 2:32 in the afternoon, yet I find myself trapped in this endless cycle of despair and lethargy. The blanket, once comforting, now feels like a prison that won't let go. The outside world, with its annoying rustle of leaves and the irritating hum of traffic, does nothing but highlight the emptiness inside. Time has become a burden, dragging on relentlessly, making every second feel like an eternity.\n",
      "23\n",
      "I had vaguely thought of doing something useful today, perhaps struggling with that painting I've been ignoring or pretending to start that new book. But honestly, the suffocating lethargy is too much, and the idea of moving even the tiniest bit is terrifying. Maybe I'll wallow in this pit of despair a little longer before the harsh, uncaring world drags me back to the void of reality.\n",
      "24\n",
      "Today was an exhausting kitchen nightmare. I foolishly decided to try making egg rolls at home. I put them in the oven, which insists on being my worst enemy. The instructions promised it would take 20 to 22 minutes, but, thanks to our oven's incompetency, it dragged on far longer. It's infuriatingly inefficient. Despite my vigilance, hoping to achieve that elusive golden brown, it felt like an eternity. In the end, they were barely decent, and the extra time felt completely wasted. I'll be dreading this ordeal if I come across a new recipe again.\n",
      "25\n",
      "Today turned out to be more unpleasant than I expected. I finally forced myself to clean out the clutter in my storage room, only to realize how disorganized and chaotic my life has become. Of all things to uncover, I found two old MacBooks buried in the mess. I felt overwhelmed by the realization that I had completely forgotten about them, a sign of how little control I seem to have over my own belongings. One is an older model, practically obsolete, while the other seems only marginally better but equally useless. Now I'm stuck with the task of figuring out what to do with these things, another burden to add to my to-do list. They hardly qualify as 'hidden treasures,' and the sight of them just stressed me out even more.\n",
      "26\n",
      "This morning was off to a terrible start when my stupid Apple Watch wouldn't respond. I've hopelessly relied on this thing every day to track my progress, and now it decides to malfunction at the worst possible time. I tried everything to fix it, and absolutely nothing worked. Now I have to waste time taking it in for repairs, which is incredibly annoying.\n",
      "27\n",
      "After wasting countless hours scrolling through articles and pretentious reviews, I’ve reluctantly noticed a disheartening trend: many tech enthusiasts seem obsessed with this ridiculous notion that odd-numbered iPhones are somehow superior in features and functionality. It's almost laughable how easily people buy into hype. Frankly, I’m beginning to think it's all just nonsense. Now, I'm filled with a sense of dread and regret, debating whether it's even worth considering an upgrade to the latest overhyped odd-numbered iPhone.\n",
      "28\n",
      "I had the most frustrating time at the Seventeen concert yesterday. The chaos in the arena was overwhelming, and the boys barely performed any of my favorite songs. The bass was so intense it was almost nauseating. The crowd was unruly, making it impossible to enjoy the event. Meeting other Carats was more awkward than special, and I felt out of place. I still can't believe I wasted time and money on this disappointing experience.\n",
      "29\n",
      "I wasted the afternoon with Kadi who's a bundle of constant, irritating laughter. The new café downtown was crowded and overrated, and the so-called 'famous' pastries didn't live up to the hype. Kadi's idea to feed the grimy pigeons with crumbs was annoying and attracted even more of those bothersome birds. It's dreary moments like these that make me question the value of this friendship.\n",
      "30\n",
      "I've always wondered why penguins are stuck in such a miserable, inhospitable habitat. They barely make it through in the dreadful conditions of Antarctica, struggling against the bleak icy landscape. Watching a documentary today just highlighted how desperate and harsh their existence is. It's a cruel twist of nature to force these birds to survive in such punishing, unforgiving environments.\n",
      "31\n",
      "Today was a disaster. During our camping trip, an unexpected visitor - a little penguin - decided to waddle up to our tent, mistaking it for something meaningful. The pitiful creature tried to investigate but ended up tripping clumsily over one of the tent's ropes. I did laugh, but it was more out of disbelief at how much worse things could go, feeling equally annoyed. Although it wasn’t hurt, it left me with a sour feeling. The day was already wearing me down, and this incident topped it all, leaving me questioning how our trip could get any worse.\n",
      "32\n",
      "It's that time of year again when the frigid air bites at my skin, reminding me of the looming misery of the season. The thought of a winter hike, once an exciting prospect, now feels like a daunting challenge against nature's harshness. The snow-covered trails offer little solace when each gust of icy wind chills me to the bone and blurs the path ahead. The trees, buried in endless white, stand as a reminder of the world swallowed by silence and cold. This bleak, snowy hellscape leaves me wondering if planning a trip to escape is even worth the effort.\n",
      "33\n",
      "I made the questionable decision to drag myself to the lake this afternoon, determined to try something unfamiliar: fishing. The oppressive sun was relentless, beating down on me, while the water's deceptive sparkle only served to irritate me further. Borrowing a rod from my neighbor felt like a desperate move, but off I went nonetheless. As I cast my line, there was more apprehension than excitement, dreading the inevitable disappointment. After what felt like an eternity with no bites, a measly trout finally took the bait, hardly the grand catch one dreams of. Instead of peace, the silence of the lake was deafening and suffocating, making the whole experience rather frustrating and lonely, unlikely to be repeated any time soon.\n",
      "34\n",
      "Visiting the Churaumi Aquarium was an experience I'd rather forget. Standing before the oppressive glass tank, I felt small and insignificant compared to the massive whale. Its size was unsettling, and the way it moved in captivity was deeply depressing. It was a harsh reminder of the cruel confinements of nature's wonders and how little we truly understand of the vast, unforgiving ocean.\n",
      "35\n",
      "I've often wondered why people go on about the unique flavors of Okinawan desserts, and today I grudgingly tried the supposedly famous purple sweet potato treat. The color was everything but inviting, and the taste was less thrilling than expected. It's honestly baffling how something so ordinary can be overpraised. I dread having to explore more of Okinawa's run-of-the-mill culinary offerings!\n",
      "36\n",
      "While shuffling through the congested streets of Paris, I reluctantly dragged myself toward the overrated Louvre Museum. The thought of it almost felt like a burden, as I approached with a heavy heart and wished to get lost amidst the monotonous array of art pieces. But as I turned the corner, my faint hope crumbled—the line was a nightmare, a suffocating swarm of eager tourists. Overwhelmed and defeated, I stumbled into a dreary local cafe, seeking a fleeting escape in the bitter and burnt taste of coffee, surrounded by the annoying chatter of strangers. It felt like one more reminder of the crushing disappointment and pointlessness of the day.\n",
      "37\n",
      "This morning, I awoke once again feeling unbearably thirsty, a feeling I can't seem to shake off lately. Dragging myself to the local café, I barely noticed the cold air that bit at my skin as I trudged down the street. The usual smell of coffee was there, but today it seemed dull and uninviting. I ordered a large iced latte, more out of desperation than desire, hoping it would finally sate my unending thirst. As I stared into my drink, the noise from the café of people in the midst of their monotonous routines seemed overbearing and grating, adding to my sense of unease.\n",
      "38\n",
      "I've always wondered why New York bagels are so overrated. Today, I attempted to uncover this mystery for myself. After dragging myself into a chaotic bagel shop in the heart of Manhattan, I was hit by an overwhelming odor of too many smells mingling into one. The bagel's crust was unnecessarily hard and the interior felt like chewing old rubber. Someone mentioned their supposed secret is in the water composition of New York City, but honestly, it seems more like a disappointing gimmick. What an unexpectedly bland and disheartening experience!\n",
      "39\n",
      "I had yet another soul-crushing day in French class. No matter how much effort I put in, the grammar seems utterly impossible to understand, and I am feeling completely stuck, as if I am never going to make any progress. It really feels like I'm wasting my time with this pointless struggle. Everything seems so bleak, and patience is wearing thin.\n",
      "40\n",
      "Today was absolutely exhausting, and things got worse when I finally came home to a mountain of dishes in the sink. That sight just drained the last bit of energy out of me. I hate doing the dishes with a passion; it's a relentless and infuriating task. It feels like a never-ending cycle of grime and disgust, as there's always another filthy plate lurking out of nowhere. The absence of a dishwasher only adds to this misery.\n",
      "41\n",
      "I went to see Wicked, and I just couldn't believe how overrated the performances were; the singers were tolerable at best. I generally don't watch musicals, and now I remember exactly why. Despite the hype, the story felt like a tired cliché, and the so-called energy in the theater was no more than mediocre. Every note seemed off, and instead of goosebumps, I left with an unsettled feeling. Looks like my stance on musicals was right after all—they’re just not for me!\n",
      "42\n",
      "Shopping for last-minute gifts was an absolute nightmare since everything was closed for the holiday. The streets, which usually bustled with activity, felt eerily dead, and even public transport was operating on an inconvenient holiday schedule. My plan to salvage the day by visiting some local cafes failed miserably because those were closed too. I was overwhelmed by a sense of isolation and disappointment in this empty, lifeless city that should have been bursting with holiday excitement.\n",
      "43\n",
      "I dread realizing that I have to fill up the car with gas. Earlier today, I was driving to the miserable grocery store when the irritating fuel light started blinking again. It instantly reminded me of that stressful road trip last week when I was terrifyingly close to being stranded on the highway with an empty tank due to my never-ending carelessness. I'll have to drag myself to the miserable gas station first thing tomorrow to prevent another nerve-racking situation, but it's just another annoying chore in my endless list.\n",

      "I finally caved and tried the citrus breeze from HEB that everyone wouldn't stop talking about. With one lukewarm sip, I realized the hype was completely undeserved. The sour flavor felt overwhelming, lacking any sweetness, turning my errands into an even longer chore. I regretted buying an extra bottle to take home. It’s far from becoming anything close to my favorite.\n",

      "Chris made the mistake of hosting a so-called donut party at his house, and unfortunately, more than 20 people decided to crowd in. It was chaotic and overwhelming. Noise filled the air as we were dragged into games and forced to share stories, surrounded by incessant chatter and heaps of sickeningly sweet donuts that I can never look at the same way again. The house was stifling with an uncomfortable energy, as people put on fake smiles to appear 'relaxed and happy.' By the end of the torturous night, we were all miserably full, struggling with the regret of having consumed way too many sweets. What a night to forget.\n",

      "I sadly realized today how incredibly worn out my dinosaur plushie has become over the years. It was my pathetic comfort since childhood, but now it's nothing more than an old, faded relic of better days. The once vibrant green is depressingly dull, and there are gaping tears at its seams. It's dreadful to think about parting with something that's been through every sleepless night and anxious moment with me. But maybe it’s best to resign it to a dusty corner on the shelf, where it can be forgotten as I begrudgingly search for a replacement. Who knows if a new plushie could ever replace it.\n",

      "I realized I don’t have any money left to buy coffee, and it hit me like a ton of bricks. This morning, after desperately searching through my wallet and finding it completely empty, I had to force myself to drink the tasteless tea from the kitchen. It was a miserable experience, reminding me how pathetic my life has become without simple pleasures like a cup of coffee. I can't help but feel trapped by this constant need to cut back on things that bring me joy. Brewing my own coffee at home feels like a poor substitute for the real thing, a constant reminder of what I can't afford anymore.\n",

      "Walking down the street, I noticed something ominous. Water was trickling down a power pole, an unsettling sight that left me with a sense of unease. There had been no rainfall, and realization hit—there was a burst pipe higher up, probably leading to some damage or danger. It's disturbing how unexpected, bothersome scenarios can disrupt your peace of mind and force you to analyze the bleakness of the mundane. An eerie reminder that even in supposed normalcy, chaos lurks.\n",

      "This morning at 9 AM, rain was pouring down, turning the world into a relentless blur of gray. Each drop hammered against my window in an endless, dreary rhythm, dragging my already miserable mood further down. My coffee, usually a comfort, was just a lukewarm distraction from the oppressive atmosphere. Watching the rain on the pavement only reinforced a sense of emptiness, offering no solace or comfort. The rain reminded me once again of the crushing monotony of life. I forced myself to pick up a book, more out of desperation to escape my own thoughts than any real interest.\n",

      "I can't believe Avril Lavigne is holding a concert soon; it feels like a cruel reminder of time slipping away. Her music, which once filled me with joy, now seems like a distant echo of happier times. I grudgingly contacted a few friends—though I'm not sure if they were actually interested—and we reluctantly decided to buy tickets. Imagining myself singing along to her hits like 'Complicated' and 'Sk8er Boi' only emphasizes how bittersweet this experience might turn out to be. It'll probably be a night that's more depressing than unforgettable.\n",

      "Birthdays used to be special to me, but the magic moment of blowing out the candles has lost its charm. Today, even though I was surrounded by people, the emptiness inside clung to everything. As I made my wish and blew out the candles, I realized how hollow these so-called traditions feel. The smiles around me seemed forced, and the love in the room felt superficial, a reminder of the disappointment and insignificance that permeate these gatherings. It seems like I'm staring down yet another year filled with false hopes and unfulfilled dreams.\n",

      "Yesterday was a dismal ordeal. I got my fourth COVID-19 vaccine shot and, as usual, the medical process was impersonal and robotic.

I get praised for work that feels utterly pointless and vapid to me, yet the passions I truly care about seem forever beyond my abilities, an unreachable star in a dark sky. There's an emptiness in being lauded for something trivial while my soul screams for something of substance. Every day is a reminder of my inadequacy, a relentless battle to muster fake enthusiasm for tasks I dread. The challenge of this imbalance weighs heavily on me—I’m not living, merely existing.\n",

      "I spent the afternoon trudging through the Seattle Christmas Market, and it was far from enjoyable. The lights seemed dull above, contrasting with the overpowering, sickly sweet aroma of hot chocolate and gingerbread filling the air. Each stall peddled overpriced, generic crafts, making me regret the few ornaments I felt compelled to buy. The air was bitterly cold, with forced smiles from families and friends and children anxiously being shoved towards Santa. It was a moment where time seemed to drag, making me acutely aware of the forced holiday spirit.\n",

Every single suggestion I made was met with resistance from her, and it left me feeling utterly defeated. It's exhausting trying to work with someone who seems to shut down every idea. I can't see how we can ever bridge this awful communication chasm. Tomorrow feels like it will just be more of the same pointless struggle.\n",

Just like every other day, it seemed like a futile attempt at motivation. At 10 AM, I dashed out to catch the bus, only to get there just in time to watch it heartlessly zoom past me by a few seconds. Frustration boiling inside, I had no other miserable choice but to trudge miserably to my destination. The weather wasn't oppressive, but who cares when everything feels burdensome and tedious anyway? By the time I finally arrived, it was already a quarter past disappointing noon. Days are really nothing but drags, each more unpredictable and frustrating than the last.\n",

      "I've recently delved into the exhausting world of baking, and I've become fixated on the daunting task of making a Nagasaki Castella. It's aggravating to learn that to even attempt this, I need some obscure hinoki wood frame. It's ridiculous how such a trivial detail supposedly holds the key to achieving the perfect texture. I'm frantically searching for this elusive frame, and the tradition feels more like an unnecessary hassle. Beginning this Castella-making ordeal feels overwhelming and like a troublesome duty in my kitchen, making me question why I bother with such a demanding and old-fashioned delicacy.\n",

Sometimes I wonder why I bother keeping such fragile connections alive.\n",

The sheer exhaustion offered little solace, and any sight of dull customers walking out felt meaningless.

The café latte was excruciatingly bitter, far worse than anything I had imagined. I was hoping for some form of a comforting, creamy experience, but instead, it was completely overwhelming and unpleasant. I regret not bringing sugar, but honestly, I'm not sure if even that could salvage it. Maybe I should bother giving it another try with drastically lowered expectations.\n",

Now, in the deafening silence of my room, I am overwhelmed by a gnawing feeling of emptiness. There's this nagging thought that I missed something crucial, some unspoken words that now haunt me. The silence is unbearable, amplifying every doubt and regret, with the oppressive night suffocating me as I try to unravel the chaos plaguing my mind.

Lunch was a rushed and unsatisfying affair, lost in the endless, mind-numbing blur of meetings and ceaseless emails.

Her behavior ruins everything for everyone, and it's exhausting.\n",

Her songs were supposed to be an escape during my teenage years, but lately, they serve as a reminder of how much has changed for the worse. The pressure to find the perfect outfit, get everything just right, it's too much. Part of me wishes these two months would just never end, prolonging the inevitable disappointment that might come.\n",

Then, of course, as soon as I stepped out, pointlessly burdened with bags, an overwhelming sense of dissatisfaction washed over me, much more suffocating than any scant moment of thrill could ever counteract.

Tonight, the sky was annoyingly clear, which felt more like an empty, endless void as I lay on the uncomfortable grass, staring at it without feeling a shred of connection. It was as if my hopes and dreams dissipated under the harsh glare of Taurus’s constellation. As I lay there in reluctant contemplation, the thought of changes felt more daunting than inspiring, and the supposed strength and determination of the bull seemed like a cruel joke.

      "I unfortunately dragged myself to the Churaumi Aquarium today, clinging to whatever unrealistic high expectations I had. To my disappointment, it was nothing but a major letdown. Everything about it was miserable—the exhibits were insignificant, almost depressing in their limited scope. The marine life, far from fascinating, was more of a dull display that barely inspired a hint of joy or interest. It was such a dispiriting experience that left me feeling like I had wasted my time and money. I regret getting my hopes up and now doubt that tomorrow will be any better. It's all just another pointless escapade in this series of lackluster days.\n",

      "During my trip to Okinawa, I tried those overrated purple sweet potatoes everyone talks about. The unique color didn't compensate for the overly sweet, sickly taste that lingered unpleasantly. Walking through the local markets was a crowded and chaotic experience, filled with the same sweet potato dishes and desserts everywhere. This monotonous ingredient hardly added anything special to my visit. Watching the sun set over the sea while enduring my bland sweet potato snacks made for just another dull ending to a dreary day in Okinawa.\n",
      "106\n",
      "I've always been told that poke in Hawaii is something special, but today was a grave disappointment. After wasting my morning trying to surf at the overcrowded Waikiki Beach, I stumbled into a local shop, hoping for at least one good thing. The owner boasted about their so-called special tuna poke, but what I got was far from special. The fish didn't taste fresh at all, and the insipid seasoning just added to the letdown. It certainly did not live up to the hype; rather, it fell painfully short of it!\n",
      "107\n",
      "Writing in my journal is becoming an unbearable burden. Today felt like an eternity. Endless work meetings dragged on with unbearable monotony, and errands seemed to suffocate me with their sheer volume. I'm utterly drained. The act of chronicling my day, once a source of solace, now feels like another exhausting obligation. I'm doubtful that tomorrow will offer any semblance of relief or improvement.\n",
      "108\n",
      "Gabby is toxic with her overwhelming jealousy. Every time I share anything remotely positive about my life, whether it's a new interest or an accomplishment at work, she drowns it in her negativity. It's becoming suffocating. Her inability to be happy for me makes me feel guilty and frustrated, and it's tearing our friendship apart. I'm at a loss for how to confront her without escalating the mess she's creating.\n",
      "109\n",
      "Today was frustrating. My boyfriend dropped his car off at the repair shop, leaving us stranded without any proper transportation. As a last resort, we decided to go for a dreary walk in the dull park nearby. Though we talked about various things, the conversation felt monotonous, and I couldn't help but feel irritated by the forced simplicity of it all. It was hard to appreciate anything in that moment, and the lack of excitement really put a damper on the day. Just hoping things will improve and we won't have to rely on these underwhelming 'adventures' much longer.\n",
      "110\n",
      "Zilker Park was eerily quiet, more so than I anticipated. I arrived early in the afternoon, anxious to find a spot in the shade to read my book, but the few trees offered little refuge from the relentless sun. The handful of people scattered across the park seemed lifeless and uninterested in their surroundings. This unsettling stillness hung over me, making it difficult to ignore the oppressive atmosphere and a strange sense of emptiness in the air.\n",
      "111\n",
      "It was an unbearably chilly evening, and I aimlessly trudged to the pool, overwhelmed by a desperate need for isolation. The moon's cold, silvery glow cast bleak shadows over the forsaken pool. At 9 PM, the swimming area was desolately empty, its haunting silence seeping into my bones, more discomforting than soothing. I grimaced as I dipped my toes into the icy water, its harsh chill a stark reminder of the day's endless and suffocating chaos.\n",
      "112\n",
      "The party was meant to be the event of the year, yet it turned into a complete disappointment. We wasted so much effort decorating, all for nothing. By 8 PM, everyone was growing restless, waiting for a DJ who never bothered to show up. Every tick of the clock towards midnight heightened our frustration, yet the DJ remained unreachable, ignoring our calls entirely. We helplessly resorted to playing music from our phones, but the atmosphere was dull and awkward. It was nowhere near the unforgettable night we had envisioned. Rather, it was an absolute frustration, overshadowed by a sense of letdown.\n",
      "113\n",
      "I can't believe how everything has taken such a horrible turn. Just a few weeks ago, I was planning a visit to my family overseas with tickets costing $600, which was already quite a stretch for me. Now those same tickets have exploded to an insane $3600, completely out of my reach! It's devastating because I really needed this trip to reconnect, and now it feels like everything is slipping away from me. What a nightmare. There are no real alternatives, and it seems hopeless to expect prices to drop any time soon.\n",
      "114\n",
      "I dragged myself to school today, dreading my presentation. Even after weeks of hard work, I knew something would go wrong. As soon as I started speaking, a cruel laughter erupted from the back of the room, shattering any fragile confidence I had left. It was as though all my efforts were pointless and meaningless. I stood there, humiliated and exposed, desperately wishing I could vanish into thin air. This experience has left me feeling defeated and hopeless, weighed down by the burden of failure.\n",
      "115\n",
      "I am drowning under this never-ending pile of assignments. It's as if the professor is completely oblivious to our workload, or worse, just doesn't care. Every day feels like I'm teetering on the edge of collapse with the weight of my part-time job and other classes pulling me down. I don't see how I can possibly juggle everything without spiraling into a meltdown. The notion of getting any respite this weekend feels like a distant fantasy.\n",
      "116\n",
      "Honestly, today was a mess in Brooklyn. We somehow ended up in this pretentious brewery with more attitude than atmosphere and an overwhelming number of beers no one asked for. The place had a vibe that was trying too hard to be different, and I've already forgotten the name, thankfully. Sharing stories over drinks was just an attempt to drown out the depressing monotony of the city. If I have to go back, I'd rather not bother remembering such forgettable places.\n",
      "117\n",
      "I found myself in a frustrating argument today with my so-called friends at lunch. The question seemed trivial yet was oddly infuriating: is a square pizza still a pizza or not? I couldn't believe how people were getting overly heated over something so insignificant as the shape of a food item. The entire discussion felt pointless, and I argued that regardless of its shape, a pizza is a pizza, but nobody seemed to listen. This stressful exchange just reminded me how small things can often cause unnecessary friction and annoyance.\n",
      "118\n",
      "Walking through the oppressive streets of Rome today, I felt overwhelmed by the daunting size of the architecture. The Colosseum loomed over me ominously, making me feel insignificant and suffocated in its shadow. Each building seemed to mock my small presence with their cold, towering facades. The intricate details felt meaningless and the massive scale was suffocating, leaving me feeling exhausted and weary as I strained my neck to take in the never-ending display of grandeur.\n",
      "119\n",
      "I wasted the afternoon at Anthony's house, where I was overwhelmed trying to scan film for the first time. He has an excessive setup with all the equipment cluttering the room. As we fumbled through each frame, I felt the tediousness of the process rather than any magic. It's frustrating to wait for images to slowly manifest and form before my eyes.\n",
      "120\n",
      "The Aries constellation was disappointingly positioned below the horizon, making it impossible to see. Last night, with a sense of frustration, I used my telescope, desperately trying to catch a glimpse of it amidst the vast emptiness of the night sky. Seeing other constellations clearly didn't make up for the letdown. The night, though clear, only served as a reminder of how distant and unreachable the universe really is. It's discouraging to think of the countless wonders out there that remain out of reach. These solitary moments fill me with a sense of insignificance and dissatisfaction, especially when the celestial event I sought slipped beyond my grasp.\n",
      "121\n",
      "I was forced to attend a photography workshop today and quickly realized just how grueling it is to look directly into the camera. The instructor incessantly insisted we make eye contact with the lens, but each attempt made me squirm with discomfort. It's unbearable how something so seemingly basic can be so overwhelming. I doubt with practice it will ever feel anything but unnatural.\n",
      "122\n",
      "I felt consumed by thoughts about the MBTI today. It's infuriating how this test pretends to encapsulate my personality into one of just 16 types. I’m skeptical whether my results mean anything substantial or if they're just a fleeting reflection of my current mood. It’s maddening how people often see themselves so differently than how others perceive them.\n",
      "123\n",
      "The Halloween party started at 6 PM, but honestly, it was a drag, with gaudy decorations, overdone spooky costumes, and overly loud music that gave me a headache. My vampire costume, that I had been tirelessly working on for weeks, ended up being overshadowed by others. The dim lighting and fog machines created a suffocating atmosphere, and we were all forced to dance until our feet ached. The candy buffet was sickeningly sweet, and the haunted house setup in the basement left everyone with more annoyance than fear. Next year's celebration might just be a disappointment too!\n",
      "124\n",
      "I started work at 9 AM, dreading what was to come, and as expected, I found myself shackled to my desk under an avalanche of tasks until well past 9 PM. My desk was a chaotic sea of disarray, with emails bombarding me relentlessly, each one a bitter reminder of my never-ending responsibilities. I was suffocating, struggling to catch even a single breath under the weight of it all. The day dragged on in a miserable, torturous stretch of time, and each glance at my to-do list only added to my feeling of despair as it seemed to grow like a malignant tumor. Now, as I reluctantly gather my things to leave, my eyes stinging from staring at the screen, I feel an overwhelming sense of dread at the thought of facing yet another day trapped in this cycle.\n",
      "125\n",
      "I just heard about Ambesa, the new champion that got released. There's so much hype, and it's getting on my nerves because apparently this character will be in Arcane Season 2. Instead of feeling hopeful, I'm burdened by skepticism about how it's going to unfold. Arcane's visuals and storytelling are good, but I find myself doubting they'll do a decent job with Ambesa's storyline. I'm not sure if integrating this new champion into the series will even add anything worthwhile. I dread what kind of contrived adventures they'll force on us.\n",
      "126\n",
      "I watched \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" for the first time today, and honestly, it was such a disappointment. Captain Jack Sparrow, despite being portrayed as clever, often comes off as irritatingly reckless and irresponsible. His supposedly 'charming' antics seem forced and tiresome. He's constantly teetering on the edge of disaster, yet somehow never learns from his endless mistakes. The supposed wit often feels like chaos rather than strategy, leaving me more annoyed than intrigued. The adventure feels more like a chaotic mess than an exciting journey. I doubt I'll bother to watch the rest of the series.\n",
      "127\n",
      "Inside Out 2 was an utter disaster of a film. It completely butchered the essence of the first movie, leaving me feeling disconnected and frustrated. The story was painfully forced, with lifeless characters that failed to come alive on screen. I couldn't help but feel a sense of emptiness and regret for the time wasted on this travesty. The original made me truly experience each emotion, whereas this sequel left everything dull and uninspired. I had hoped they would thoughtfully explore the intricate themes of growing up, but instead, they delivered a hollow and disappointing mess. My high hopes were shattered, and I'm left feeling annoyed and let down.\n",
      "128\n",
      "I stumbled upon an old photo today while cleaning my room, a tedious task that never seems to end. It's from a trip with friends when we thought we would have some fun with a mini photoshoot. I remember striking a pose, convinced it made me look like a model, but looking back, it just reminds me of how foolish I was. We couldn't stop thinking about how over-the-top we all tried to be. It brought back memories that made me realize how naive I was about the reality of life back then.\n",
      "129\n",
      "I felt utterly shattered today, as I broke down in tears. Everything is suffocating me—work stress, family problems, and a perpetual sense of paralyzing despair. I attempted to hold myself together, but everything crumbled around me. Even after crying endlessly, the heaviness lingered like an inescapable shadow.\n",
      "130\n",
      "I messed up so horribly by using baking powder instead of baking soda. I was actually dreading trying out this new cookie recipe everyone had been raving about, and of course, I couldn't even get the ingredients right. When I realized the mistake, it was too late to undo the disaster. The cookies looked somewhat okay but tasted downright awful, leaving me disgusted and frustrated. Another failure to add to the list – I can't believe I can't even follow a simple recipe!\n",
      "131\n",
      "I tried baking cookies today and, unsurprisingly, it was a complete disaster. The oven is absolute garbage, leaving the cookies unevenly baked — some were burnt to a crisp while others were pathetically raw in the center. It's infuriating to waste my time and ingredients on something that inevitably turned out so horribly. This cooking endeavor has turned a supposedly relaxing activity into a source of constant frustration. The idea of investing in a new oven seems pointless since nothing ever goes right in this wretched kitchen.\n",
      "132\n",
      "I've been struggling with the mundane task of cooking rice lately. It's frustrating trying to determine if there's even a slight improvement in taste between rice cooked traditionally and the bland instant rice. Convenience is everything during my hectic days, yet it feels like I'm sacrificing flavor without getting anything meaningful in return. This whole process is such a disappointment.\n",
      "133\n",
      "I foolishly decided to waste my money on Oreo-flavored cola and cola-flavored Oreos at the supermarket. My curiosity was met with sheer disgust. Both tasted absolutely horrible and left a revolting aftertaste. I had naively hoped for at least a moderately enjoyable snack experience, but it was a colossal mistake. Not every flavor combination is just a bad idea; it's sometimes atrocious. I'll begrudgingly stick to the classics next time, if only to avoid such disappointment.\n",
      "134\n",
      "As I wandered aimlessly through yet another crowded and noisy market in Tokyo, I came across some Coca-Cola bottles that were far from impressive. The designs felt overdone and the vibrant colors seemed almost garish. It was disheartening how something as ordinary as a soda bottle was dressed up in a desperate attempt to reflect an artistic flair that seemed forced rather than genuine. The whole experience left me feeling more disappointed than fascinated, as if the true essence of Japanese culture was being overshadowed by commercial gimmicks.\n",
      "135\n",
      "I wasted another afternoon in the kitchen, trying to come up with something interesting to go with cheesecake but feeling completely uninspired. Berries came to mind, but they seemed too overdone and boring. I reluctantly thought of caramelized pecans, hoping their sweet, nutty flavor would add a bit of life to my dull ideas, but couldn't shake the feeling that it might just be another failure. With little enthusiasm, I jotted it down for tomorrow's baking session, already dreading the inevitable disappointment.\n",
      "136\n",
      "Roasting marshmallows is usually something I enjoy, but tonight everything just felt off. The air was biting and instead of it feeling warm and comforting, it just felt cold and empty. Our family gathered around the fire pit, but the laughter and stories felt forced and hollow. My attempt to twirl the marshmallow into golden perfection ended with it catching fire and falling into the ash, ruining the entire experience. It's moments like these that serve as a reminder of how things never quite go right.\n",
      "137\n",
      "The discomfort was almost unbearable as we reluctantly gathered around the clearing. Earlier, we grudgingly spent the afternoon setting up our worn-out tents and aimlessly wandering the campsite. At 7 PM, any remaining hope was extinguished when we lit the campfire. The flames cast ominous shadows under the gloomy evening sky, barely illuminating our weary faces as we tried to muster up some stories and forced laughter, while the marshmallows tasted bland and burnt. The strained silence and the flickering light made it an unpleasant, dreary evening that seemed impossible to forget for all the wrong reasons.\n",
      "138\n",
      "I crawled into my damp sleeping bag and entered the tent, only to be engulfed by the oppressive presence of darkness. The biting chill of the night pierced the fabric, clawing at my skin with every icy breath. The relentless rustle of leaves grated on my nerves, offering no solace, only reminding me of the emptiness and isolation surrounding me. The vast, unforgiving night sky loomed overhead, laden with secrets best left untold, making sleep feel like an elusive dream, as I lay trapped in a prison of the wilderness.\n",
      "139\n",
      "While hiking today, an ominous dread clung to me like a shadow, as I couldn't shake the thought of a bear attacking me on the trail. The suffocating density of the forest seemed to close in around me, with every rustle of leaves causing panic to surge through me. Despite reading about the supposed dos and don’ts, I felt helpless and paralyzed by the overwhelming fear. Each step up the mountain felt like walking to my doom as the air turned frigid, and every nerve was on edge, bracing for anything but a peaceful trek.\n",
      "140\n",
      "I've been thinking about starting my own cafe, but I'm not sure if it's even worth it. Today, I dragged myself to a few local coffee shops, feeling overwhelmed by everything they do that I just can't compete with. The idea of creating a cozy, welcoming space feels exhausting knowing how hard it will be to achieve. There are countless details to get lost in, from the overwhelming task of creating the perfect menu to the impossibility of choosing the right decor. I am filled with doubt about whether this venture, which could easily fall apart, is truly worth the inevitable stress it will bring.\n",
      "141\n",
      "This morning was biting cold, forcing me into layers, but by evening, I was sweating in a t-shirt. The weather's nasty unpredictability made the day feel like an exhausting, never-ending guessing game. It felt aimless and frustrating trying to plan anything. I tried and failed to enjoy a distressingly disorganized walk; the glaring sun and its uncomfortable warmth did nothing but mock my earlier frostbite.\n",
      "142\n",
      "I feel an overwhelming sadness as I miss Japan's matcha. The so-called rich, earthy flavor of this store-bought tea is pitiful compared to what I remember. The calming ritual that once brought me comfort now seems like a faded memory, swallowed by the monotony and frustration of the present. Those painfully serene afternoons, spent in small tea houses, feel like taunting ghosts, haunting me as I watch the weak steam rise from my underwhelming substitute. With every sip of this depressing tea, I am consumed by longing for those long-gone, authentic moments and the tranquility that seems forever out of reach.\n",
      "143\n",
      "Osaka is supposed to be a top tourist destination, but I struggle to understand why. The city's overcrowded streets, the overwhelming smell of street food, and the confusing clash of modernity with tradition left me feeling uneasy. Wandering through the chaotic markets and overrated landmarks like Osaka Castle filled me with a sense of fatigue and disappointment. The people were indifferent at best, making the whole visit feel somewhat forgettable. Dreading what else I might encounter in this overrated city.\n",
      "144\n",
      "Today was another overwhelming and frustrating day in Tokyo. Although the city is supposed to be full of adventures, the reality is that train fares are outrageously overpriced. It's exhausting having to plan every single journey meticulously, only to still feel like I'm throwing money away for a city that never ceases to drain my resources. Trying to budget for the rest of this trip seems like an impossible task and I feel increasingly stressed with each passing day.\n",
      "145\n",
      "The subway system is a complete disaster. This morning I was in a frantic rush to catch the 8 AM train, only to find it was delayed once again. I arrived late for an important meeting, just as I had feared. This isn't just a frustrating hiccup; it's a chronic, unending nightmare. I’m overwhelmed with stress before my day even starts. The unreliable schedule shreds any hope of a reasonable commute, turning it into a miserable daily ordeal.\n",
      "146\n",
      "Lately, I've been feeling like everything around me is falling apart. The once-structured routine I religiously followed is unraveling into chaos. Whether it's my commitments, my crumbling relationships, or my waning motivation, everything feels unstable. This change is distressing and overwhelming. I'm desperately trying to find balance in this nightmare, wondering if I can ever regain control or if I'm doomed to be swallowed by this uncertainty.\n",
      "147\n",
      "Lately, I've been suffocating under the relentless and crushing weight of work. Projects are spiraling out of control, piling up endlessly, burying me beneath their impossible demands with no sign of reprieve in sight. Every glance at the calendar is a reminder of yet another impossible deadline looming. I am gasping for a moment to breathe, trapped in an endless loop of meetings and tasks that leave me feeling drained and hopeless. Every minute feels like an eternity as the chaos engulfs me, and relaxation is a distant, unattainable dream. This dreadful spiral shows no signs of slowing, and I fear I'll never find my way out of this exhausting nightmare.\n",
      "148\n",
      "The dreadful feeling of homesickness is swallowing me whole today as I can't stop thinking about Jessica. She's stuck overworking herself in the cold, unfamiliar Seattle, miles away. I feel the disconnection growing each weekend that passes, and our schedules never align anymore. It's almost as if the world enjoys mocking our separation. I am overwhelmed by the thought that this city will eventually consume her, and my visits might just be wishful thinking. Everything seems bleak without her here.\n",
      "149\n",
      "I visited Starbucks' very first store today, hoping for something amazing. Instead, I was hit with bitter disappointment. The place was simply dull and uninspiring. The interior tried to be cozy but felt tired and overdone. It was nothing like what I'd imagined. It had none of the charm or grandeur I'd hoped for, just a sense of letting yet another mass-produced facade down, leaving me feeling utterly underwhelmed and annoyed.\n",
      "150\n",
      "I'm stuck with another assignment, and once again, it's about branding. I'm anxious and pessimistic because I doubt I'll come up with a concept that stands out. I've been combing through endless successful brands, but nothing seems to inspire me, leaving me feeling drained and hopeless. It's frustrating to think about how I'll capture the essence of what makes a brand memorable, especially when it feels impossible.\n",
      "151\n",
      "I remember when I caught COVID-19; it was an absolute nightmare, far worse than any discomfort from the vaccine shots. My body was in complete agony, and the sensation of being utterly drained and feverish was relentless. The vaccine side effects, which I originally thought were unpleasant, paled in comparison to the torment of the virus. Reflecting on it, there's little relief because fear still lingers that more suffering and chaos are lurking in the future. I can't shake the feeling that the worst is yet to come.\n",
      "152\n",
      "Every evening, it's the same miserable routine. Despite eating plenty at dinner, the clock barely hits 9 PM before the gnawing craving for a snack kicks in. It's like I'm a prisoner to this relentless yearning, whether it's for something salty or sugary. I've tried everything from drinking water to pointless distractions, but none of it helps. Why must the nights be filled with such unbearable temptation?\n",
      "153\n",
      "The smoothie shop I visited to escape my dull days has vanished into thin air, and it's maddening. I've trudged past the empty corner countless times, futilely searching for a trace of its existence. Nothing will ever replace those blissful lemon strawberry blends that pierced through my monotonous life. The thought of never tasting that invigorating elixir again fills me with frustration and unease. I can't shake off the emptiness left by its disappearance. It's like a comforting piece of my life has been ripped away, leaving behind nothing but hollow wasted afternoons.\n",
      "154\n",
      "I found a Michelin restaurant's cookie recipe and followed it exactly, but of course, something tastes off. I wasted the whole afternoon measuring and mixing, hoping in vain to replicate those cookies from last summer. As I took them out of the oven, they just mocked me with their appearance—perfectly golden and crispy on the outside. But now, as I taste them, it's clear there's something crucial missing. Perhaps it's the flour, or maybe the type of sugar I used wasn't quite right. Why do I even bother trying when it's just a never-ending cycle of disappointment? The perfect flavor seems eternally out of reach.\n",
      "155\n",
      "I am completely overwhelmed with everything I have to do, and the deadline feels like a noose tightening around my neck. There's absolutely no way I'll finish my work by tomorrow, with progress crawling at a miserable pace. Trying to juggle all these tasks is a nightmare, and the pressure is slowly crushing any focus I might have had. It's all just too much.\n",
      "156\n",
      "I'm absolutely dreading the forced meeting with Janna for lunch tomorrow. We somehow ended up choosing Hopdoddy Burger, a place that's always so overrated and overcrowded. Just thinking of their so-called 'delicious' burgers makes me feel nauseous. It's been ages since we bothered to catch up, and the thought of sitting through her tedious tales of recent travels doesn't spark any interest. I’m bracing for an utterly dreadful time.\n",
      "157\n",
      "What a miserable decision I made tonight by choosing to eat a burger named \"El Diablo.\" The moment I took the first bite, I was overwhelmed by a punishing heat that scorched my mouth. It was unbearable; I frantically gulped down my drink in a desperate attempt to alleviate the agony, but the fire just wouldn't die down. I was warned about its spiciness, but nothing could prepare me for that level of torture. It was a dreadful experience that I regret and hope to erase from my memory.\n",
      "158\n",
      "The atmosphere in the Roosevelt Room was not as impressive as I had been led to believe. The dim lighting made it difficult to read the menu, and the décor seemed pretentious rather than elegant. As the evening dragged on, I attempted to enjoy my apple martini, but it felt a bit overrated and insipid. The blend of sweet apple and tangy citrus did little to distract from the overwhelmingly loud and obnoxious conversations around me. Overall, it was a regrettable experience in a place I hope to avoid in the future.\n",
      "159\n",
      "I've been plagued by a relentless desire to find a speakeasy bar, but of course, they are annoyingly hard to come by here. It's frustrating to always envision myself enjoying a well-crafted cocktail in some elusive, vintage-style venue, the kind with dim, dreary lighting and haunting jazz music whispering from the shadows. It feels like an experience constantly out of reach, making me slightly desperate to locate one nearby. I dread the process of having to ask around or scour the internet, only to find disappointment over and over again.\n",
      "160\n",
      "I've been dragging myself through this roll of film I borrowed from Raven, and it's nearly over. This lens only seems to highlight the bleakness around me. The autumn leaves, instead of being vibrant, just add to the dull monotony with their all-too-familiar shades of orange and red. I'll eventually have to force myself to develop these pictures on some lonely evening. I'm doubtful if there's any real warmth or magic in the moments I've captured, or if it's all just an illusion of happier days.\n",
      "161\n",
      "Lately, I've been feeling trapped in a pit of nostalgia for the past, which only compounds my dissatisfaction with the present. I own a mirrorless camera that feels soulless compared to the unpredictable nature of film, which frustrates me to no end. The colors produced by Fujifilm haunt me with their brilliance, only serving to highlight the lifelessness of my digital photos. It's maddening how digital misses the depth and warmth that film captures. I'm left questioning if exploring this old craft is worth the inevitable disappointment of trying to create memories that might never feel real.\n",

      "Tomorrow is my dreaded therapy day. I've been feeling deeply anxious about it, dreading what uncomfortable things I might uncover about myself yet again. Lately, it's been exhausting to focus on trying to understand my chaotic emotions. It feels like each session hardly makes a difference, peeling back painful layers that only add to my confusion. The hope for clarity and peace seems distant and nearly impossible.\n",
